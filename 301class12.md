## SQL vs NoSQL database
- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distrubuted database.
- SQL db are table based db whereas NoSQL db are document based, key-value pairs, graph db or wide-column stores. 
- SQL rep data in form of tables which consist of n number of rows of data wherea NoSQL db are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph db or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
- SQL db use (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data. NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (unstructured Query Language). 
- SQL db examples: MYSQL, Oracle, Sqplie, Postgres and MS-SQL.
- NoSQL db examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDb.
- For Complex queries: SQL db are a good fit. NoSQL don't have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL.
- NoSQL db fis better for the heirarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL are preferred for large data sets. 
- SQL db are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc. 
- NoSQL are horizontally scalable. You can add a few more servers easily in your db infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
- SQL are best suited for high transactional based applications- it's more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data.
- SQL db emphasizes on ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durabitly). NoSQL the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance).
- SQL can either be open-source or closed sourced from commercial vendors. NoSQL db can be classified on the basic of way of storing data as graph db, key-value db, document db, column db and XML db.
