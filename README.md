## Growth mindset is believing that your most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This perspective creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for *advancement* and *great* accheivements. 

- Learning from failures
- Remembering that nothing is easy at first
- I don't know how... **yet**!

## These are my reading notes...

### Growth Mindset      
* Embraces Challenges   
* Persists Obstacles     
* Maximum effort      
* Learns from Criticism 

### Fixed Mindset
* Avoids Challenges 
* Loses Focus on Obstacles
* Unproductive or useless
* Ignores Criticism

### Text Editor 
* It's a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text (especially for websites)
* Can be downloaded or accessed via your web browsers
* Very important tool for web devs
* Best text editor is the one you enjoy the most- pros and cons for all of them - try them all!

### Text Editor Features
* Code completion - list possible suggestions based on what you type - saves time, less typing, less errors
* Syntax highlighting - colorizing text, easier to find errors, easier to read
* Variaty of themes- for eye strain and comfort 
* Good selection of extensions - like plugins for you text editor, adds functionality as you need it, helps you accomplish more with less effort

### OS Text Editor vs Third Party
* OS text editors work, but have less features, harder to write code, no "bells and whistles"
* Make sure you're coding in plain text - no bold, italics or underlines options
* For OS Text editor, Create folder on computer to store entire website, save files to the appropiate folder/sub-folder with correct extension (.html, .css)
* Third Party options- NotePad++, TextWrangler/BB edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, Sublime Text

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* All-in-one package- text editor, compiler, debugger and file manager
* Similar to Microsoft Outlook - email client, calender, to-do list, task manager
* Probablly not needed for a beginner web dev
