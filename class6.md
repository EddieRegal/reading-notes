### Javascript New Vocabulary 
* Javascript
* conditionals
* data types
* variable

### CSS 
* stand for Cascading Style Sheet
* It's a language used to give styling and desgin to webistes
* It is the standard for styling webites, used by most/all websites
* Usually goes hand-in-hand with HTML
* used for Styling, layout and design, animations, font changes,           organization and grid systems

### How computers work
* what makes a computer, a computer?
* computers are changing the world from pocket devices to desktop PCs
* Everyone uses it but most don't know how they work 
* Computers use circuits to do everything from simple math to VR worlds
* The 4 different parts of a Computer: CPU, Memory, Input and Output
* What exactly is Code and how does this software control Hardware?

### What makes a computer, a computer?
* how does it even work?
* Computers are tools that help us solve complex problems - it's a thinking machine
* it takes input, stores, process and outputs
* Early computers were made out of wood and metals with mech levers and gears
* Early PC were slow and very large
* PC started out as basic calculators 
* Input- the stuff that the outside world does that make computers do stuff- touch screen, mouse, cam, keyboard, watch. 
* Display- shows texts, games, VR, photos, videos and even signals to controls robots 

### How computers work - DATA & Binary 
* computers work on ones and zeroes on the insides
* wires and circuits carry all the information in a computer
* How do you store data/information with electricty?
* The binary number system- 0 and 1
* Any number can be respresented by 1 or 0
* More wires, more numbers 
* Text, images and sound are all represented with 1/0s in binary code
* Sound 32bit is better than 8bit audio... has more data points 


### Circuits and Logic 
* every input and output is information 
* computers modify multiple inputs 
* Simple ON/OFF circuits take an electrical signal and flips it
* Circuit with 2 bits is called an adder 0+0=00

### Memory, CPU, Input and Output
* Input devices converts physical inputs to binary information 
* Memory stores this information 
* Cpu processes this information 
* Outputs to screen display binary code into pixels, output devices can be lots of different things 

### Hardware and Software
* Hardware- circuits, wires, chips, speakers, plugs
* Software- is code/programs running on machine
* How does the software and hardware communicate?
* CPU - master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
* CPU recieves simples commands that tells it which circuit to use to complete a job (add, store, output, etc)
* Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all hardware of computer
* Binary code is not used to create new programs
* All current coding languages are designed on top of the binary language
* OS - The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
